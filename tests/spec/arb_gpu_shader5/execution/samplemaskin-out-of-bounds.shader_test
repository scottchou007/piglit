/* From section 5.7 "Structure and Array Operations" of the GLSL 1.50 spec:
 *
 *  "Behavior is undefined if a shader subscripts an array with an index less
 *   than 0 or greater than or equal to the size the array was declared with."
 *
 * The behaviour becomes defined only in robustness extensions, however even
 * if driver is technically allowed to crash or hang, it most likely
 * doesn't want to.
 *
 * gl_SampleMaskIn may be handled differently in a driver than ordinary arrays.
