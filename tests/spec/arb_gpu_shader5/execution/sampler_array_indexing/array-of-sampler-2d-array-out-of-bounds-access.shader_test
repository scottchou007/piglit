/* From section 5.7 "Structure and Array Operations" of the GLSL 1.30 spec:
 *
 * "Behavior is undefined if a shader subscripts an array with an index less
 *  than 0 or greater than or equal to the size the array was declared with."
 *
 * The behaviour becomes defined only in robustness extensions, however even
 * if driver is technically allowed to crash or hang, it most likely
 * doesn't want to.
 *
 * Robustness extensions encourage to us to return zero on out-of-bounds
 * read, however it's not clearly applicable to the array of opaque types.
 * What will happen when we call a built-in function which expects the
 * opaque type with the instance returned from oob access?
 * In the spirit of the spec - I think neither compilation should fail nor
 * a hang occur.
