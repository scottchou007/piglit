/* From section 5.7 "Structure and Array Operations" of the GLSL 1.30 spec:

 *
 * The behaviour becomes defined only in robustness extensions, however even
 * if driver is technically allowed to crash or hang, it most likely
 * doesn't want to.
 *
 * gl_ClipDistance may be handled differently in a driver than ordinary arrays.
