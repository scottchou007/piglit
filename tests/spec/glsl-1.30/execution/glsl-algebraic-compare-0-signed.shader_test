# Note: this test requires glsl-1.30 because it's the first version that says
# that integers are 32-bit and defines overflow behavior (Section "4.1.3
# Integers" of the glsl spec). Before that integers had 16-bits precision
# and overflow was explicitly undefined.

[require]
GLSL >= 1.30

[vertex shader]
#version 110

{
	gl_Position = gl_Vertex;

void main()
{
	// signed overflow in GLSL is defined to wrap around since glsl 1.30
	if (1 + x <= 0)
		gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
	else
		gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
